## About
This is a simple kanji dictionary in a familiar style for Japanese learners looking to find new Kanji or remember existing ones.


This site uses the [**KANJIDIC**](http://nihongo.monash.edu/kanjidic2/index.html) dictionary which contains numerous pieces of additional data which can be used to identify each kanji. The site has a total of 10350 kanji ranging from the most used to lesser used ones.


Each kanji has information regarding its Kunyomi and Onyomi readings as well as the English translation. You can search with either the English Japanese character sets including Romaji, Hiragana, Katakana and Kanji. The current system ranks search results by newspaper frequency to try and estimate relevance, although I would be willing to listen to any suggestions to try and improve this.

## Getting Started
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
